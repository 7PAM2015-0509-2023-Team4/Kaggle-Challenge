# Kaggle-Challenge

In 2912, data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery involving the Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner with 13,000 passengers. The ship collided with a spacetime anomaly, causing almost half of its passengers to be transported to an alternate dimension, similar to its predecessor 1000 years ago.

Training data: Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, are used as training data. Passenger details of the following features are given in the train.csv file.

<ul>
<li>PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.</li>
<li>HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.</li>
<li>CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage.</li> <li>Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.</li>
<li>Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard. </li>
<li>Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.</li>
<li>Age - The age of the passenger.</li>
<li>VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.</li>
RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.</li>
Name - The first and last names of the passenger.
Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.
</ul>
